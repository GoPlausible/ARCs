# Algorand Transaction Calling Conventions

## Abstract

This document introduces conventions for encoding method calls,
including argument and return value encoding, in Algorand Application
call transactions. 
The goal is to allow clients, such as wallets and
dapp frontends, to properly encode call transactions based on a description 
of the interface. Further, explorers will be able to show details of
these method invocations.

### Definitions

* **Application:** an Algorand Application, aka "smart contract", 
  "stateful contract", "contract", or "app".
* **HLL:** a higher level language that compiles to TEAL bytecode.
* **dapp (frontend)**: a decentralized application frontend, interpreted here to
  mean an off-chain frontend (a webapp, native app, etc.) that interacts with
  Applications on the blockchain.
* **wallet**: an off-chain application that stores secret keys for on-chain
  accounts and can display and sign transactions for these accounts.
* **explorer**: an off-chain application that allows browsing the blockchain,
  showing details of transactions.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

> Comments like this are non-normative.

Interfaces are defined in TypeScript. All the objects that are defined 
are valid JSON objects, and all JSON `string` types are UTF-8 encoded.
