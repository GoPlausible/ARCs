## Abstract
This ARC proposes a simple yet effective and generally accepted approach to model all kinds of hierarchical elements within Algorand ecosystem and not just NFTs , without changing context or metadata interpretation tools! The proposed method is based on using already existing metadata and extend it to support hierarchy by adding two new fields: "children" and "parent"!
By aligning to this ARC, all avm elements can enjoy hierarchical structure using either metadata (in case of Assets), box storage (applications) and DIDs for accounts, addresses and transactions!

These conventions for using Algorand blockchain elements in hierarchical structures can be implemented as an extension to:
