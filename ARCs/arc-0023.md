## Abstract

The following document introduces a convention for appending information to the compiled application's bytes. 
The goal of this convention is to standardize the process of verifying and interacting with smart contracts. The encoded byte is `arc23` followed by the length of the CID representing a folder of files & the CID itself.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

> Comments like this are non-normative.

### CID
The <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/cid">CID</a> allows to access the corresponding files using <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>.

The CID **MUST** represent one file or a folder of files.
The minimum requirement for this ARC is a file representing the ABI (ABI as described in [ARC-4](arc-0004.md))

### Encoding
The encoded byte is `arc23` followed by the length of the CID, the number of files, and the CID itself.

eg: for the example stored in `/asset/arc-0023/Folder`, 
`arc23 59 2 bafybeihdzhfifv46p27ee6weqq6h7ydttzwni7gvdogr3mg6rwscdyzici`
`bafybeihdzhfifv46p27ee6weqq6h7ydttzwni7gvdogr3mg6rwscdyzici` correspond to this Folder: `../assets/arc-0023/Folder`. It can be obtained with `ipfs add --cid-version=1 Folder/*  -q -w -n| tail -1`

If there is only one file, the CID **MUST** be related to the ABI of the application. 
eg: `arc23 59 1 bafkreiajguyi3i5hf4h7blslsv53rjbexzzvpkyhdf26hmuqthrk4iko4a`
`bafkreiajguyi3i5hf4h7blslsv53rjbexzzvpkyhdf26hmuqthrk4iko4a` correspond to this Abi File: `../assets/arc-0023/Folder/Abi.json`. It can be obtained with `ipfs add --cid-version=1 Folder/Abi.json -q`

> The option -n is for obtaining the hash without pinning the file, you **MAY** remove the option in production

Otherwise, if there is more than one file, the CID must correspond to a folder of files. The ABI **MUST** be accessible by querying and IPFS node with `{cid}/Abi.json`
eg:`bafybeihdzhfifv46p27ee6weqq6h7ydttzwni7gvdogr3mg6rwscdyzici/Abi.json`.

### Appending
The encoded byte is appended to the compiled application as a <a href="https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/teal/opcodes/#bytecblock-bytes">bytecblock</a> containing 1-byte constant which is the encoded object.
> The reason to use `bytecblock` is that adding a `bytecblock` opcode at the end of a TEAL program does not change the semantics of the program, as long as opcodes are correctly aligned, there is no jump after the last position (that would make the program fail without `bytecblock`), and there is enough space left to add the opcode.
The size of the compiled application + the bytecblock should be, at most, the maximum size of a compiled application according to the latest consensus parameters supported by the compiler.

## Rationale
By appending the IPFS CID of the folder containing information about the Application, any user with access to the blockchain could easily verify the Application and the ABI of the Application and interact with it.

## Reference Implementation
The following codes are not audited and are only here for information purposes.

Here is an example of a python script that can generate the hash and append it to the compiled application, according this ARC:
[main.py](../assets/arc-0023/main.py).
The output is here [output.txt](../assets/arc-0023/output.txt)

A Folder containing: 
- example of the application [Application.py](../assets/arc-0023/Folder/Application.py).
- example of the Abi that follow [ARC-4](arc-0004.md) [Abi.json](../assets/arc-0023/Folder/Abi.json).


Files are accessible through followings IPFS command:
```console
$ ipfs cat bafybeihdzhfifv46p27ee6weqq6h7ydttzwni7gvdogr3mg6rwscdyzici/Abi.json
$ ipfs cat bafybeihdzhfifv46p27ee6weqq6h7ydttzwni7gvdogr3mg6rwscdyzici/Application.py
```

## Security Considerations
CIDs are unique; however, related files **MUST** be checked to ensure that the application conforms. 
An `arc-23` CID added at the end of an application is here to share information, not proof of anything.
