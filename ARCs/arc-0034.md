## Abstract
The purpose of this ARC is to set the parameters for proposals submitted by the community for evaluation by xGovs prior to a general governance vote for final approval.
 
The Foundation’s goal is to ensure that the xGov process is defined by, and executed by, the Algorand community.

The xGov program will cover evaluation of proposals regarding grants to fund early stage projects and other community input contributions.
 
## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.
 
Being able to put measures for a vote is a significant upgrade to the power of the governors. Governors with this power **MUST**:
- Understand the needs of the community
- Have their interests aligned with the growth of the Algorand ecosystem
 
### Template to submit a proposal

```json 
{
	'Title': 'Name of the proposal',
	'Project': 'Name of the project',
 'Details': 'Details about the proposal', 
	'Category': 'Submission Category, DEFI/NFT ...',
	'Url': 'Webiste url',
	'Ask': 'Grants/ Investiment/ Advice',
	'RoadMap': [
	 {
		 'Miletone': 'Explanation of what will be achieved during this period',	
	  'Duration': 'Duration in month for current milestone',
  },
  …
 ]
}

## Rationale
In this ARC we seek community input on issues such as:
- How to submit a proposal?
- How to distribute xGov funds?
- What is the criteria for funding?
- What is the timeline for project implementation?
- How are milestones managed?
- How much funding should be dispersed at each milestone?
- What happens if a project doesn’t keep up with their obligations?
- How is the evaluation process executed?
- How can reforms to the program be implemented?
- How many proposals will be shortlisted for voting at each general governance period?
- Should there be an application window for each governance epoch?
