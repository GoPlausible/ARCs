## Abstract

The goal of this proposal is to increase transparency and efficiency in the decision-making process by clearly defining the steps involved and ensuring that all proposals are given proper consideration. 
 
## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.
 

### What is a proposal
A proposal within the xGov program aims to provide funding for:
- Funding for early stage projects
- Facilitation of community involvement
- Addressing the needs of the community
 
### Duty of a proposer
Having the ability to propose measures for a vote is a significant power, which requires:
- A thorough understanding of the needs of the community
- Alignment of personal interests with the advancement of the Algorand ecosystem.
> Issues requiring resolution may have been discussed on various online platforms such as forums, discord, and social media networks.


### Voting System
The voting system for the xGov program will be the following:
- Only members of xGov are eligible to participate in the voting process
- Utilization of the Algo commited by xGov as a form of voting currency, with a 1:1 ratio of Algos to votes
- Proposals that do not meet the minimum threshold of votes required will be removed from consideration.

### Threshold 
In order for a proposal to be approved, it is necessary for the number of votes in favor of the proposal to be proportionate to the amount of funds requested. This ensures that the allocation of funds is in line with the consensus of the community and is in accordance with democratic principles.

> eg. 2 000 000 Algo are available to be given away as grants, 200 000 000 millions Algo are commited to the xGov Process (200 000 000 votes available):
> - Proposal A request 100 000 Algos (5 % of the Amount available)
> - Proposal A needs 5% of the votes (10 000 000 Votes) to go through

### Life of a proposal
The proposal process will have the same duration as the governance period. Within the 3 months, the following steps will be implemented:
- Anyone can submit a proposal at any time. Proposals will be hidden to prevent bias.
- 0.5 months after the start of a governance periode, proposals submitted will be revealed. 
- 1 month is allocated for proposals refinement and temperature check. Proposals will be evaluated and refined by the community and xGovs.
- 1 month is allocated for voting on proposals. The community will vote on proposals that have passed the refinement and temperature check stage.
- 0.5 months for negotiation and claiming grants. Proposals that have been approved will be negotiated and grants will be claimed.

### Submit a proposal
In order to submit a proposals, a proposer needs to fill a form on the website provided for this purpose: <a href="">URL TBD</a>.

### Grants calculation
The allocation of grants will be distributed proportionately among selected proposals, taking into consideration the revised funding request amounts.
> The foundation will initiate contact with the proposal's originator to negotiate final terms and conditions.

## Rationale

The current status of the proposal process includes the following elements:

- Proposals will be submitted off-chain.
- Projects that require multiple funding rounds will need to submit separate proposals.
- The allocation of funds will be subject to review and adjustment during each governance period.
- Voting on proposals will take place on-chain.
- There is currently no maximum limit set on the number of proposals that can be voted on.

Other considerations that have been discussed include:
- Allocating funding in two stages, with 25% provided at the start of the project and the remaining 75% distributed upon approval by the xGov vote (on another quarter).

We encourage the community to continue to provide input on this topic through the submission of questions and ideas in this ARC document.
