## Abstract
This ARC provides TEAL which would deploy a application that can be used for burning Algorand Standard Assets. The goal is to have the apps deployed on the public networks using this TEAL to provide a standardized burn address and app ID.

## Motivation
Currently there is no official way to burn ASAs. While one can currently deploy their own app or rekey an account holding the asset to a vanity address, having a standardized address for burned assets allows explorers and dapps to display burnt supply for every ASA.

## Specification

### `ARC-4` JSON Description
```json
{
  "name": "ASABurnApp",
  "desc": "",
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "optIntoASA",
      "args": [
        {
          "name": "mbrPayment",
          "type": "pay",
          "desc": "The payment that covers the opt-in MBR for the contract"
        },
        {
          "name": "asa",
          "type": "asset",
          "desc": "The ASA to opt in to"
        }
      ],
      "desc": "Sends an inner transaction to opt the contract account into an ASA. The fee forthe inner transaction must be covered by the sender. Will fail if the contractis already opted in to the asset or if the asset has a clawback address set.",
      "returns": {
        "type": "void",
        "desc": ""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rationale
This simple application is only able to opt in to ASAs but not send them. As such, once an ASA has been sent to the app address it is effectively burnt.

The app prevents itself from opting into an asset that has a clawback address set to prevent tokens that were once considered to be burnt to go back into circulation. This means any token with a clawback address set cannot be burnt via this app.

## Reference Implementation
```
#pragma version 9

// This TEAL was generated by TEALScript v0.42.0
// https://github.com/algorand-devrel/TEALScript

// The following ten lines of TEAL handle initial program flow
// This pattern is used to make it easy for anyone to parse the start of the program and determine if a specific action is allowed
// Here, action refers to the OnComplete in combination with whether the app is being created or called
// Every possible action for this contract is represented in the switch statement
// If the action is not implmented in the contract, its repsective branch will be "NOT_IMPLMENTED" which just contains "err"

## Security Considerations
It should be noted that once an asset is sent to the contract there will be no way to recover the asset.

To do the simplicity of a TEAL, an audit is not needed. The contract has no code paths which can send tokens, thus there is no concern of an exploit that undoes burning.
