## Abstract
This standard is inspired by <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551">EIP-6551</a>
The goal is to allow an ASA to detain & manage ASAs or Algo through a ”vault”.

## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### Glossary
In the document we will use following syntax:
- Authority ASA -> ASA that indicate an Application ID that detain & manage others ASAs
- Vault -> Application ID holding ASAs of the Authority ASA

### Metadata field
In order to allow wallet to identify the vault of the Authority ASA must be specified in the metadata.
Using [ARC-16](./arc-0016.md):
```json
{
  "title": "Authority ASA",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "vault_id": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "Application ID holding ASAs of the Authority ASA"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Authority ASA",
  "description": "I have control over other ASAs through my vault",
  "properties": {
    "vault_id": 123456789
  }
}
```
### Interface
```json
{
  "name": "ARC-41",
  "desc": "Authority ASA's Vault Base Interface",
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "isOwner",
      "desc": "Indicate if the caller detain the Authority ASA of this vault, this method MUST be called internally by every other methods of the application",
      "readonly": true,
      "returns": { "type": "bool", "desc": "True if the caller detain the Authority ASA of this vault, False otherwise" }
    },
    {
      "name": "optInAsa",
      "desc": "Opt-in ASA in the vault",
      "readonly": false,
      "args": [
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "assetId" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    },
    {
      "name": "transferAlgoFrom",
      "desc": "Transfers Algos outside of the Vault",
      "readonly": false,
      "args": [
        { "type": "address", "name": "from" },
        { "type": "address", "name": "to" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    },
    {
      "name": "transferAsaFrom",
      "desc": "Transfers ownership of an ASA",
      "readonly": false,
      "args": [
        { "type": "address", "name": "from" },
        { "type": "address", "name": "to" },
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "assetId" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    }
  ]
}
```
## Rationale
Linking the vault ID to the Authority ASA using the Metadata allows to have backwards compatibility with current implementations.
The design using an application has vault rather than a logic sig is more flexible and secure.

## Backwards Compatibility
This stantard is compatible with ASAs that can be updated [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) + [ARC-19](./arc-0019.md) or [ARC-69](./arc-0069.md).

## Security Considerations
The method `isOwner` **MUST** be called internally by the logic of every other method of the application to ensure that the caller detain the Authority ASA.
