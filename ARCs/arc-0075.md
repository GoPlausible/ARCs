# Standardized way for users to whitelist applications 

## Abstract
The goal is to allow an account to show its will to dApps to be part of an application.

If integrated into ecosystem technologies, including wallets, explorers, and dApps, this standard can provide enhanced capabilities around Applications (eg [ARC-72](arc-0072.md)).

## Motivation
Algorand allows to store of addresses inside an Application. However, this does not require any approval from related accounts.

This ARC allows dApps to know which application an account is willingly part of and wants to interact with.

## Specification
The keywords "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### TEAL Smart Contracts

There is one smart contract being utilized: The [whitelist_registry](../assets/arc-0075/whitelist_registry.ts)

#### Registry

##### Storage

| Type | Key     | Value          | Description                                  |
| ---- | ------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Box  | Account | Application ID | Applications' registry for the given account |

##### Methods

###### ADD to Whitelist
* Creates/Add a registry for a given account
* Creates box: `account` -> application ID
* App/box MBR funded by the creator

###### SET a Whitelist
* Set a registry of `Applications' ID` for a given account
* Creates/Delete box: `account` -> application ID
* App/box MBR funded by the creator (if adding)
* App/box MBR funded by the creator (if deleting)

###### DELETE from Whitelist
* Deletes box: `account` -> registry ID
* App.box MBR returned to registry creator

###### DELETE Whitelist
* Deletes registry app
* Deletes box: `account` -> registry ID
* App.box MBR returned to registry creator

## Rationale
This design was created to offer a standard mechanism by which wallets, explorers, and dapps could enable users to whitelist Applications without requiring any changes to the core protocol.  

## Reference Implementation
### Source code
* [ARC-75 TypeScript](../assets/arc-0075/whitelist_registry.ts)

## Security Considerations
Even if an account does not whitelist an application, it does not prevent the same application from storing the address of this account.
