# Standardized way for users to whitelist applications 

## Abstract
The goal is to allows an account to shows is will to dApps to be part of an application.

If integrated into ecosystem technologies including wallets, epxlorers, and dApps, this standard can provide enhanced capabilities around Applications (eg [ARC-72](arc-0072.md)).

## Motivation
Algorand allows to store addresses inside an Application, however, this does not require any approval from related accounts.

This ARC allows dApps to know which application an account is willingly part of and wants to interact with.

## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### TEAL Smart Contracts

There are one smart contract being utilized: The [whitelist_registry](../assets/arc-0075/whitelist_registry.ts)

#### Registry

##### Storage

| Type | Key     | Value          | Description                                  |
| ---- | ------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Box  | Account | Application ID | Applications' registry for the given account |

##### Methods

###### ADD to Whitelist
* Creates/Add a registry for a given account
* Creates box: `account` -> application ID
* App/box MBR funded by the creator

###### SET a Whitelist
* Set a registry of `Applications' ID` for a given account
* Creates/Delete box: `account` -> application ID
* App/box MBR funded by the creator (if adding)
* App/box MBR funded by the creator (if deleting)

###### DELETE from Whitelist
* Deletes box: `account` -> regristry ID
* App.box MBR returned to regristry creator

###### DELETE Whitelist
* Deletes regristry app
* Deletes box: `account` -> regristry ID
* App.box MBR returned to regristry creator

## Rationale
This design was created to offer a standard mechanism by which wallets, explorers, and dapps could enable users to whitelist Applications without requiring any changes to the core protocol.  

## Reference Implementation
An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.  If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/arc-####/`.

### Source code
* [ARC-75 TypeScript](../assets/arc-0075/whitelist_registry.ts)

## Security Considerations
Even if an application is not whitelisted by an account, it does not prevent the same application to store the address of this account.
