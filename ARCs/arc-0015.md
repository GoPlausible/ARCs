# Encrypted Short Messages 

## Abstract

The goal of this convention is to have a standard way for block explorers, wallets, exchanges, marketplaces, and more generally, client software to send, read & delete short encrypted messages.

## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

> Comments like this are non-normative.

### Account's message Application

To receive a message, an Account **MUST** create an application that follows this convention:

- A Local State named `public_key` **MUST** contain an `NACL Public Key (Curve 25519)`

- A Box `inbox` where:
  - Keys is an ABI encoded of the tuple `(address,uint64)` containing the address of the sender and the round when the message is sent
  - Values are encoded **text**

> With this design, for each round, the sender can only write one message per round.
> For the same round, an account can receive multiple messages if distinct sender sends them

### ABI Interface

The associated smart contract **MUST** implement the following ABI interface:
```json
{
  "name": "ARC_0015",
  "desc": "Interface for an encrypted messages application",
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "write",
      "desc": "Write encrypted text to the box inbox",
      "args": [
        { "type": "byte[]", "name": "text", "desc": "Encrypted text provided by the sender." }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    },
    {
      "name": "remove",
      "desc": "Delete the encrypted text sent by an account on a particular round",
      "args": [
        { "type": "byte[]", "name": "address", "desc": "Address of the sender"},
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "round", "desc": "Round when the message was sent"}
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    },
    {
      "name": "set_public_key",
      "desc": "Register a NACL Public Key (Curve 25519) to the global value public_key",
      "args": [
        { "type": "byte[]", "name": "public_key", "desc": "NACL Public Key (Curve 25519)" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rationale
Algorand blockchain unlocks many new use cases - anonymous user login to dApps and classical WEB2.0 solutions being one of them. For many use-cases, anonymous users still require asynchronous event notifications, and email seems to be the only standard option at the time of the creation of this ARC. With wallet adoption of this standard, users will enjoy real-time encrypted A2P (application-to-person) notifications without having to provide their email addresses and without any vendor lock-in. 

There is also a possibility to do a similar version of this ARC with one App which will store every message for every Account. 

Another approach was to use the note field for messages, but with box storage available, it was a more practical and secure design.

## Reference Implementation

The following codes are not audited and are only here for information purposes.
It **MUST** not be used in production.

### Application Pyteal (Beaker) application.py

```python
from typing import Final
from pyteal import *
from beaker import *
from beaker.lib.storage import Mapping

algod_client = sandbox.get_algod_client()

# Use a box per member to denote membership parameters
class SR(abi.NamedTuple):
    address: abi.Field[abi.Address]
    round: abi.Field[abi.Uint64]

class Master(Application):
    public_key: Final[ApplicationStateValue] = ApplicationStateValue(
        stack_type=TealType.bytes,
        default=Bytes(""),
        descr="A Public Key use to encrypt the message",
    )
    inbox = Mapping(SR, abi.String)

    @external(authorize=Authorize.only(Global.creator_address()))
    def set_public_key(self, public_key: abi.String):
        return self.public_key.set(public_key.get())

    @external
    def write(self, text: abi.String):
        return Seq(
            (s := abi.Address()).set(Txn.sender()),
            (r := abi.Uint64()).set(Global.round()),
            (v := SR()).set(s, r),
            self.inbox[v].set(text))   

    @external
    def remove(self, address: abi.Address, round: abi.Uint64):
        return Seq(
            (v := SR()).set(address, round),
            Pop(self.inbox[v].delete())
            )

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app = Master()
        app.generate_teal()
        app.dump("./artifacts")
  ```

    sender_round = abi_encode(SR(), (acct_sender.address,current_round))

    #Write messages to receiver App

        print(f"Decrypted Text: {plaintext.decode('utf-8')}")

    #Delete the message
    app_sender.call(
        Master.remove,
        boxes=[[app_client.app_id, sender_round]],
        address=acct_sender.address,
        round=current_round
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo()
```


## Security Considerations
Even if the message is encrypted, it will stay on the blockchain. 
If the secret key used to decrypt is compromised at one point, every related message IS at risk.
