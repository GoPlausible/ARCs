# Interface & Conventions for Soul Bound Algorand Standard Asset

## Abstract
The goal is to make it simpler for block explorers, wallets, exchanges, marketplaces, and more generally, client software to identify & interfact with a soul bound NFT ASA.

This defines an interface extending [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md) & [ARC-69](./arc-0069.md) non fungible ASA to create soulbound ASA. Before issuance, both parties (issuer and receiver), have to agree on who has (if any) the authorization to burn this ASA. 

> This spec is compatible with [ARC-19](./arc-0019.md) to create an updatable SoulBound ASA.

## Motivation
The idea of [ARC-71](arc-0071.md) soulbound ASAs has gathered significant attention. Without a standard interface, however, soulbound ASAs are incompatible. It is hard to develop universal services targeting at soulbound ASAs without minimal consensus on the implementation of the ASAs.

This ARC envisions soulbound ASA as specialized NFTs that will play the roles of credentials, credit records, loan histories, memberships, and many more. In order to provide the flexibility in these scenarios, soulbound ASAs must have an application-specific burn method and a way to distinguish themselves from regular ASA.

## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

Non Burnable Soulbound ASA: An ASA that can not be remove from a wallet
Burnable Soulbound ASA: An ASA that can be move from a wallet in order to be burn
Burn Manager: The address allowed to call the burn method of associated soulbound token

### ASA Addresses Parameters

### ASA Parameters Conventions
We can differenciates 2 Soulbound ASA, Burnable and not Burnable: 
- Burnable Soulbound ASA
- Non-Burnable Soulbound ASA
  
#### Not Burnable Soulbound ASA
- The `DefaultFrozen` **MUST** be set to true.
- The Creator parameter, the ASA **MAY** be created by any addresses.
- The Clawback parameter **MUST** be the `ZeroAddress`.
- The Freeze parameter **MUST** be set to the `ZeroAddress`.
- The Manager parameter **MAY** be set to anything.
- The Reserve parameter **MAY** be set to anything.

> In case of Not Burnable Soulbound, not application is requried.

#### Burnable Soulbound ASA
> This is an implementation of the [ARC-20](./arc-0020.md) Smart ASA specification.
- The `DefaultFrozen` **MUST** be set to true.
- The Creator parameter, the ASA **MAY** be created from a Burn Manager Application.
- The Clawback parameter **MUST** be the Burn Manager address.
> Since the Burning relies on using the Clawback mechanism, the Clawback **MUST** not be set to the zero address. 
- The Freeze parameter **MAY** be set to anything.
- The Manager parameter **MUST** be set to the Burn Manager address.
- The Reserve parameter **MAY** be set to anything.

##### Burn Manager ABI Interface
The Burn manager is the address that can burn the ASA.
It should be set when the ASA is controlled by Managing Application. And **MUST NOT** be updatable.

The application **MUST** implement the following ABI:

```json
{
  "name": "ARC_0071",
  "desc": "Interface for a burnable soulbound algorand standard asset",
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "get_burn_manager",
      "desc": "Get burn manager address",
      "readonly": true,
      "args": [
        { "type": "asset", "name": "asset", "desc": "The desired asset" },
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "address", "desc": "The address allowed to burn the asa." }
    },
    {
      "name": "burn",
      "desc": "Burn a given ASA after checking if the caller is the burn manager",
      "args": [
        { "type": "asset", "name": "asset", "desc": "The desired asset to burn" },
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    },
  ]
}
```
The SHA-512/256 hash of 'get_burn_manager(asset)address' is: 0x98364967
The SHA-512/256 hash of 'burn(asset)void' is: 0xe5fd94d8

The interface selector for this core interface is `0x98364967 XOR 0xe5fd94d8 = 0x7dcbddbf`.

## Rationale
### Soulbound ASA NFT 
Soulbound token serves as a specialized subset of the existing ASAs. The advantage of such design is seamless compatibility of soulbound token with existing NFT services. Service providers can treat Soulbound ASA NFTs like other ASAs and do not need to make drastic changes to their existing codebase.

### Burn Authorization
We want maximum freedom when it comes to interface usage. A flexible and predetermined rule to burn is crucial. Here are some sample scenarios for different burn authorizations:
- IssuerOnly: Loan record
- ReceiverOnly: Paid membership
- Both: Credentials
- Neither: Credit history
Burn authorization is immutable after issuance. It is therefore important to inform the receiver and gain receiver’s consent before the token is issued.

## Backwards Compatibility
ARC-3, ARC-69, ARC-19 ASAs can be converted into a Non-Burnable SBD ASA if the manager address & freeze address are still available.

ARC-3, ARC-69, ARC-19 ASAs can be converted into a Burnable SBD ASA if the manager address & freeze address & clawback address are still available.

## Security Considerations
Creating/Receiving a non-burnable SBD ASA will lock Algo forever.
