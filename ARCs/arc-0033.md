## Abstract
This ARC proposes a standard for achieving xGov status in the Algorand governance process. xGov status grants the right to vote on [ARC-34](./arc-0034.md) proposals raised by the community, specifically spending a previously specified amount of Algo in a given epoch on particular initiatives. 


## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### What is an xGov?
xGovs, or Expert Governors, are a select group of decentralized decision makers who demonstrate an enduring commitment to the Algorand community, possess a deep understanding of the blockchain's inner workings and realities of the Algorand community, and whose interests are aligned with the good of the blockchain. These individuals have the ability to participate in the designation of proposals, and play an instrumental role in shaping the future of the Algorand ecosystem.

### Requirement to become an xGov
To become an xGov, or Expert Governor, an account:
- **MUST** first be deemed eligible by having fully participated in a previous governance period, either through official or approved decentralized finance governance. 
- At the start of each governance period, eligible participants will have the opportunity to participate in the xGov process
- To gain voting power as an xGov, the user **MUST** commit their Algo governance rewards for a year.

### Voting Power
Voting power in the xGov process is determined by the amount of Algo an eligible participant commits. For every one Algo committed, a participant will be allotted one vote. This ensures that the weight of each vote is directly proportional to the level of investment and commitment to the Algorand ecosystem.

### Duty of an xGov
As an xGov, you **MUST** actively participate in the governance process by voting on at least 90% of proposals during each period. Failure to do so will result in disqualification. 
> Your vote can be either "Yes", "No" or "Neutral" depending on your stance on a given proposal.

### Disqualification
As an xGov, it is important to understand the importance of your role in the governance process and the responsibilities that come with it. Failure to do so will result in disqualification. The consequences of disqualification are significant, as the xGov will lose the rewards that were committed when they entered the xGov process. It is important to take your role as an xGov seriously and fulfill your responsibilities to ensure the success of the governance process.

> The rewards will remain in the xGov reward pools & will be distributed among remaining xGovs

## Rationale
This proposal provides a clear and simple method for participation in xGov process, while also providing incentives for long-term commitment to the network. Separate pools for xGov and Gov allow for a more diverse range of participation, with the xGov pool providing an additional incentive for longer-term commitment. The requirement to vote on at least 90% of available proposals will ensure that participants are actively engaged in the decision-making process. 

After weeks of engagement with the community, it has been decided:
- That the xGov process will not utilize token or NFT.
- There will be no minimum or maximum amount of Algo required to participate in the xGov process
- In the future, the possibility of node operation being considered as a form of participation eligibility is being explored

This approach aims to make the xGov process accessible and inclusive for all members of the community.

We encourage the community to continue to provide input on this topic through the submission of questions and ideas in this ARC document.

## Security Considerations
No funds need to leave the user's wallet in order to become an xGov.
