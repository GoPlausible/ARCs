## Abstract
xGov status gives a governor the right to vote on proposals raised by the community, to ratify the proposals as valid for final community vote, where said proposals pertain to spending a previously specified amount of Algo in a given epoch on particular initiatives.
 
The purpose of this ARC is to define the standard by which xGov status is achieved.
 
## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.
 
### What is an xGov
Expert Governors (xGov) are decentralized decision makers who demonstrate enduring commitment, are knowledgeable of the realities of the Algorand community, and whose interests are aligned with the good of blockchain.
 
xGov **SHOULD** understand the community's needs and align their interests with those of the Algorand ecosystem.
xGov **MAY** propose measures for a vote.
xGov **MAY** participate in the designation of proposals.

### Requirement to become an xGov
The Foundation suggests that to become an xGov an Algo holder **MUST**:
- Participate in a reward-bearing AF program
- Commit the rewards to an xGov DAO for a period
> Each xGov DAO is related to a vertical ( art's NFT, DEFI, Community Creators ... )
> The period of commitment tends to be a year 
> The minimum participation to the reward-bearing AF program tends to be 1 Algo

The foundation will maintain lists of eligible reward-bearing programs, and a list of qualified DAOs.
 
### Duty of an xGov
Each quarter, an xGov **MUST** vote on a certain number of proposals submitted to an xGov DAO, he will be disqualified otherwise.
> 1 Algo commited to the rewar-bearing AF program = 1 Vote available for a proposal
> A vote can be Yes/No/Neutral 
> The minimum number of votes is still to be determined.
> After a disqualification, an xGov will lose his reward committed to the DAO


#### Example
Alice participates in governance during Q1 2023
the potential reward is 5 Algo, Alice:
1) Commit 100 Algo in an AF program
2) Express her will to participate in xGov
3) Will not receive 5 Algo at the end of Q1 2023. They are instead locked in one big xGov pool for 1 year
4) Will receive 5 Algo at Q1 2024
 
## Rationale
In this ARC we seek community input on issues such as, but not limited to:
- The types of reward-bearing activities that **SHOULD** be included in the qualification list (ie. general governance)
- Whether xGovs **MUST** vote on all measures to keep their status
- Whether xGovs tokens **SHOULD** be sold/transferred or **SHOULD** be burned when exiting the xGov DAO
- Whether xGovs tokens expire after a year or gain more voting power if the stake remains in the DAO
- Whether there **SHOULD** be a minimum and a maximum amount of Algos required to become an xGov
- Whether there be a maximum amount of Algos that can be locked by xGovs for the each period, limiting the total number of xGovs
- Whether xGovs **SHOULD** be disqualified and lose their status if they behave in a suboptimal fashion
- What types of suboptimal behavior would trigger disqualification or loss of status?
- Whether new xGovs be allowed into the pool at every quarter or only once per year

Community members can add their own questions and solutions to the above list
 
## Security Considerations
Funds committed by an xGov to a reward-bearing activity (except for official governance) are the user's responsibility.
