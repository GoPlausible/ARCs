## Abstract
xGov status gives a governor the right to vote on proposals raised by the community, to ratify the proposals as valid for final community vote, where said proposals pertain to spending a previously specified amount of Algo in a given epoch on particular initiatives.
 
The purpose of this ARC is to define the standard by which xGov status is achieved.
 
## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### What is an xGov

Expert Governors (xGov) are decentralized decision makers who demonstrate enduring commitment, are knowledgeable of the realities of the Algorand community, and whose interests are aligned with the good of blockchain.
 
xGov **SHOULD** understand the community's needs and align their interests with those of the Algorand ecosystem.

xGov **MAY** propose measures for a vote.

xGov **MAY** participate in the designation of proposals.

### Requirement to become an xGov
To become an xGov, a user must have an account that **MUST**:
- Have participated in full at a previous Governance period (Through official or approved defi governance)
  
	OR

- Participate actively in consensus.

This account **MUST** soft-commits ALGOs to gain voting power to allocate between several xGov DAO.
> Each xGov DAO is related to a vertical (DeFi, Web3, Gaming, and Impact)

### Voting Mechanism
An xGov **MAY** participates in multiple xGov DAO but **MUST** participates in at least one.
> Participating in multiple xGov DAO means splitting the voting power (eg, Alice soft-commits 100 Algo on being an xGov, she may choose to have 50 Votes for Defi, 25 for Gaming & 25 for Impact)

1 Algo soft-commited = 1 Vote

The foundation will maintain a list of qualified DAOs.

### Duty of an xGov
For each period, an xGov **MUST** vote on at least 90% of proposals submitted to xGov DAOs he chose, he will be disqualified otherwise.
> A vote can be Yes/No/Neutral 
> After a disqualification, an xGov will no longer be able to vote for the year he commited to. 

If the account has registered to the xGov program by running a node, he **MUST** have at least 90% uptime with his node.

## Rationale
In this ARC we seek community input on issues such as, but not limited to:
- The types of reward-bearing activities that **SHOULD** be included in the qualification list (ie. general governance)
  - Current Status:
    - No incentive or reward-bearing activities needed fo qualification
    - Having participated in full at a previous Governance period allow an account to be eligible as xGov
- Whether xGovs **MUST** vote on all measures to keep their status
  - Current Status:
    - xGov must vote on 90% of proposals
- Whether xGovs tokens **SHOULD** be sold/transferred or **SHOULD** be burned when exiting the xGov DAO:
  - Current Status:
    - No token
- Whether xGovs tokens expire after a year or gain more voting power if the stake remains in the DAO
  - Current Status:
    - No increase of power
- Whether there **SHOULD** be a minimum and a maximum amount of Algos required to become an xGov
  - Current Status:
    - No minimum nor maximum
- Whether there be a maximum amount of Algos that can be locked by xGovs for the each period, limiting the total number of xGovs
  - Current Status:
    - No minimum nor maximum
- Whether xGovs **SHOULD** be disqualified and lose their status if they behave in a suboptimal fashion
  - Current Status:
    - Disqualified for the rest of the year committed
- What types of suboptimal behavior would trigger disqualification or loss of status?
  - Current Status:
    - Vote on less than 90% of proposals
    - For node runner, Vote on less than 90% of proposals & less than 90 uptimes for the node
- Whether new xGovs be allowed into the pool at every quarter or only once per year
  - Current Status:
    - A period will be 2 months, new xGovs allowed every period
  
Community members can add their own questions and solutions to the above list
 
## Security Considerations
By using a soft-commits, no fund will leave the wallet for beeing an xGov.
